# Into the Dungeon
> Dungeon multiplayer game that can be played single- or multi-device. 

## General info
You and other adventurers want to kill all the monsters lurking in a dungeon. 
But you're not a team: only one player can enter the dungeon, impersonating a 
previously chosen hero character. 

In every round the players either remove pieces of the hero's equipment or add 
monsters in the dungeon, making the quest more difficult every time. At some 
point the players will start stepping back in turns, giving up the task to the 
last brave or reckless player standing. You succeed in the dungeon if you can 
kill all monsters before they take all your character's hit points.

This process will be repeated many times, with different hero characters. You 
will be out of the game if you're killed in the dungeon twice. Otherwise you 
will win if you survive the dungeon twice or if every other player is out of 
the game. 

## Built with
This project was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev).

ðŸ”Ž **Nx is a set of Extensible Dev Tools for Monorepos.**

Nx chosen presets make use of:
* [Angular](https://angular.io/) for the front-end.
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) for the back-end.
* Both Angular and NestJs make use of [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
* NestJS also makes use of [Express](https://expressjs.com/).
* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) framework for writing and running tests.

Other libraries and dependencies I use:
* [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) for theming.

## Status
_in progress_

Currently working on the one-device side of the front-end app.

## Latest updates

## Play
There is still no deployed version of this game.

## Inspiration
The game is closely inspired by a board game I played with my housemates. The 
project serves only a learning purpose, so I claim no originality with regard 
to the rules and content of the game. However, in order to avoid copyright 
issues I'll try to include as many changes as possible.
